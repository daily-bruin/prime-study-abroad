				<p>Walking through the streets of Florence, Italy, stained my white Birkenstocks a dingy brown. The ash from the citizens&rsquo; chain-smoking created a black sealant over every exposed surface. Most days, I spent my time looking down at my blistered toes, avoiding cobblestone ditches and dog poop, all on a sidewalk that fit 0.26 of my person. Scents rotated between heavenly baking pane and the sewage of thousands.</p>

				<p>And then, whenever I looked up, I saw architecture that dated back centuries. I zigzagged through narrow streets of graffitied buildings, which stood perpendicular to designer stores. On my way to class, I passed the David replica, crossed the Ponte Vecchio and Fiume Arno and attempted to enter the Basilica di Santo Spirito, which holds an original Michelangelo. Firenze is a city that breathes history in addition to pollution. Its locals move at a slower pace, making time for two-hour lunch breaks and kisses on both cheeks.</p>

				<p>My first weeks in Italy, I fluctuated between grateful, terrified, morose and exhilarated. Having never left the country before, I ignored all my degree requirements to &ldquo;push myself out of my comfort zone.&rdquo; But I hadn&rsquo;t realized that I might have to actually face the repercussions of foreignness while roughly 6,000 miles away from Los Angeles.</p>

				<p>The thing is, every study abroad experience is more or less the same. I tried to &ldquo;study&rdquo; by exploring my city and traveling to new countries overnight. I was open &ndash; to places and to people &ndash; and constantly ready for the next adventure. I spent most of my money on transportation, cheap booze and castle views. Momentarily, I felt waves of homesickness when confronted with an unexpected cultural barrier, or a friend&rsquo;s first-day-of-school Instagram post. When people say studying abroad will change your life, it isn&rsquo;t an exaggeration. Thanks to the people who let me into their lives, I made a city halfway across the world into a home; their stories are the special ones.</p>

				<p>For three months, Signora Gabriella Bianchi cooked, cleaned and joked in Italian, while I lived in her spare bedroom. Inarguably the head of the house, Gabriella mocked the simpering princess television shows that her granddaughters, or nipoti, loved &ndash; complaining that intelligent women had worked too hard for this to remain the model for young girls.</p>

				<p>In Italy, families remain tight-knit &ndash; uniti &ndash; and Gabriella&rsquo;s house held her daughter, son-in-law and three bambini: Sara, age 6; Ghaia, age 4; and il beb&egrave; Zach. The apartment was also shared with three birds, one guinea pig, one kitten and my housemate, Annie Erdahl from Minnesota.</p>

				<p>A mother to three and host mother to countless, Gabriella put up with my stutters and mispronunciations with loving chagrin &ndash; reminding me her last students spoke only Italian at home. Each evening, a &ldquo;pronto&rdquo; at my door signaled my favorite time of day.</p>

				<p>Homemade lasagna, stew and tiramis&ugrave; would appear &ndash; and then disappear &ndash; in front of Annie and me. Sempre buoni. Gabriella asked if we wanted seconds while putting them on our plate. Zach giggled at us from his high chair, and tiny Ghaia begged to mango &ndash; or eat &ndash; again.</p>

				<p>Gabriella has traveled and eaten her way around the world &ndash; from California to Africa to Egypt &ndash; drawing the line at tasting spiders and dog.</p>

				<p>She likes American action movies, John Steinbeck and &ldquo;Who Wants to be a Millionaire.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Marcella Delitala is from Sardegna, an island off the coast of southern Italy. For three hours Monday through Thursday mornings, she taught basic Italian to 20 tired &ndash; and occasionally hungover &ndash; college students. In the course of one semester, Marcella somehow coaxed us through three consecutive language levels. Every morning, she bicycled past me with a &ldquo;buongiorno.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>Petite and brunette, dressed in flowing pants and sweaters, Marcella is 42 but looks a decade younger. She has three children and claimed she could do without 17 more &ndash; she couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh when half of our questions began with &ldquo;come si dice&rdquo; and &ldquo;che significa.&rdquo; With remarkable energy and exaggerated facial expressions, she rearranged our seats every day and forced a new language into our reluctant brains.</p>

				<p>With an &ldquo;allora,&rdquo; the class began a piedi. We groaned and circled up as she reached for the tiny colored ball that signaled the beginning of popcorn verb conjugations and counting exercises.</p>

				<p>Marcella made examples with our names on the board to help ingrain grammar lessons. She took pictures of us on class outings and counted her ducklings as we trailed behind her.</p>

				<p>She studied abroad in Ohio, does silly dance moves and ordered me chestnut cake &ndash; castagnaccio &ndash; at the farmer&rsquo;s market.</p>

				<p>Annie Rimmon is a third-year applied mathematics student from Los Angeles with multigenerational Italian roots. Program mates constantly asked us if we were friends pre-arrival, as I blushed from embarrassment.</p>

				<p>We met last year at UCLA Volunteer Day, where I managed a gardening site at a local elementary school. Annie was a lead volunteer, and she said I was good at being nice &ndash; after which I ignored her on campus. This may or may not be entirely factual, but I cannot imagine my study abroad experience without her.</p>

				<p>Annie is one of the most genuinely warm people I have ever met &ndash; so warm that she&rsquo;s able to make the people near her feel warm too. She holds an ability to discover patterns and beauty in nearly everything and cares about people to a fault.</p>

				<p>For the past three months, she kept poking me on the arm &ndash; whether we were looking out over the city from Piazzale Michelangelo or pestering our friend with singing &ndash; and saying, &ldquo;Look, we&rsquo;re in Italy,&rdquo; reminding me how fortunate we were.</p>

				<p>She writes her own songs, takes improvisational comedy classes and wants to be a radio host.</p>

				<p>***</p>

				<p> There were the owners of the corner sandwich shop from school who taught me the Italian names of vegetables. There was the restaurant manager who invited me to his band&rsquo;s jam session. There was the old man who stared out of his garage shop every morning &ndash; as if he was always waiting for someone &ndash; when I walked by for class. There were Italians who adopted me, Italians who catcalled me and Italians who ignored me.</p>

				<p>My favorite thing about Florence &ndash; not including a gelato from Gelateria Perch&eacute; no! or Gabriella&rsquo;s roasted melanzana &ndash; is the people. Waiting for a check without prompting could take an entire night, and don&rsquo;t count on anything being open in the early morning or afternoon. Tempo al tempo, or all in good time. People in Italy seem content to spend time with their family, eat good food and smoke.</p>

				<p>I&rsquo;m ambitious. But living in Florence has given me perspective on a different pace of life &ndash; with a slowness, and sometimes ineffectiveness, that I probably couldn&rsquo;t maintain for very long. Nonetheless, I hope to return with a greater awareness of all I have to appreciate. And most importantly, I want to return with the same mentality that I embraced while abroad: one of openness, whether that means to the coastline of California, the new neighborhood caf&eacute; or the stranger standing near me at the bookstore.</p>
